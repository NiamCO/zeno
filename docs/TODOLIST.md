# TODO - Just For You

## RIGHT NOW - Test What You Have
1. Open `apps/home/index.html` in browser
2. Click around - does it work?
3. Try theme switcher
4. Type in notes widget
5. Refresh page - does it save?

## Fix These First (If Broken)
- [ ] Sidebar toggle button
- [ ] Theme switcher icons
- [ ] Search box actually searching
- [ ] Make notes save properly

## Make It Actually YOURS
1. **Change colors** in `packages/design-system/theme.css`
   - Pick YOUR favorite colors
   - Make it look how YOU want
   
2. **Add YOUR data**
   - Change "User" to your name
   - Put real email subjects
   - Add your actual schedule

3. **Deploy it**
   - Run the deploy script OR
   - Just copy files to GitHub Pages
   - Make it live at yourusername.github.io/zeno

## What To Build Next (Pick ONE)
### Option A: Mail App (Most Useful)
apps/mail/index.html - Basic inbox
apps/mail/styles.css - Make it look good
apps/mail/app.js - Load real emails (use Gmail API later)

text

### Option B: Calendar App (Second Most Useful)
apps/calendar/index.html - Monthly view
apps/calendar/styles.css - Make calendar pretty
apps/calendar/app.js - Add/edit events

text

### Option C: Fix Dashboard More
- Make widgets draggable
- Add more widgets you actually want
- Better mobile view

## Quick Checklist Before Adding More:
- [ ] Current dashboard works 100%
- [ ] No JavaScript errors in console
- [ ] Looks good on phone
- [ ] You actually LIKE using it

## When Stuck:
1. Check browser console (F12)
2. Look at existing code for patterns
3. Google the error
4. Or just hack something that works

## Remember:
- It's YOUR app, make it work for YOU
- Don't build features you won't use
- Ugly but working > Pretty but broken
- You can always change it later

## Next Steps After This File:
1. **Close this chat**
2. **Open your code in Codespaces**
3. **Start fixing/adding what YOU want**
4. **Make it actually useful for YOU**

Good luck. Just build something.
