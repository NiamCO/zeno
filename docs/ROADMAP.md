## Quick Wins (Do First):
1. **Fix bugs** - Make current dashboard solid
2. **Add real data** - Connect to actual email/calendar APIs
3. **Mobile responsive** - Make it work on phones
4. **Offline mode** - Work without internet

## Real Talk:
This is a side project. Build what YOU need first. Fancy features later.
Focus on making ONE app actually useful (probably Mail or Calendar).
